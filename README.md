# 🎯 AI/ML Engineer-Rushi L

Welcome! I’m an AI/ML engineer who spends my time **learning, experimenting, and building** end-to-end projects that mirror real production systems.  
I focus on **LLM-driven automation, applied machine learning, scalable data pipelines, and MLOps workflows** through self-directed projects and open-source exploration.

## 💡 Highlight Project: Multi-Document Research Paper Summarization Chatbot

### 📘 Problem  
Reading research papers is essential—but not always practical when short on time or attention.  
To solve this, I built a **Multi-Document Chatbot** that summarizes research papers and answers questions across multiple PDFs.

### 🔧 What I Built  
- Setup → RAG pipeline → FastAPI integration → testing → deployment on AWS ECS (Fargate)  
- End-to-end retrieval-augmented generation system  
- Fully containerized application with CI-friendly structure  
- Cloud-hosted, scalable deployment

### 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **LangChain** – RAG pipeline  
- **DataStax AstraDB** – Vector store  
- **Python** – Backend + AI logic  
- **FastAPI** – API layer  
- **Pytest** – Testing framework  
- **AWS ECS (Fargate)** – Cloud deployment  
- **Streamlit / HTML / CSS** – Frontend UI  

### 📊 What It Can Do  
- Upload multiple research papers  
- Chunk → embed → store → retrieve relevant context  
- Generate accurate summaries and answers  
- Provide citations to specific documents  
- Runs on a scalable AWS Fargate setup  

> *Built as a self-driven project to explore RAG systems, cloud deployment, and efficient LLM-based summarization.*
